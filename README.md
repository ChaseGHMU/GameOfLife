# GameOfLife

Conway's Game of Life iOS App built by Chase Allen using Swift and UIKit

### Example
![](GameOfLife.gif)

The game currently allows you to draw your own starting "alive" squares and then run the simulation to see what happens. A square's color will change based on how long the square has been alive. Any square that's been alive for longer than 5 generations will become red. The colors will progressively get "hotter" as the square lives longer.

### TODO
- Add the ability for the user to reset the map
- Add Randomize Button
- Add Ability to change grid size
- Add Buttons for traditional starting spots? (Gun, Spaceship, etc)
